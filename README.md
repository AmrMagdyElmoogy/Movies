# Architecture

The Movie Application is built using the MVVM architecture with a Single Activity and Unidirectional Data Flow patterns. This design ensures a clean and scalable structure for the application.

### MVVM Architecture

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the UI and interacts with the user.
- **ViewModel:** Manages the UI-related data and communicates with the Model.

### Single Activity

The app follows a single-activity architecture, reducing complexity and improving navigation.

### Unidirectional Data Flow

The app implements a unidirectional data flow to ensure a predictable and maintainable codebase. Data flows in a single direction, making it easier to debug and understand.

# Project Architecture Overview

Our project follows a clean architecture pattern, dividing the codebase into three distinct layers for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

## Presentation Layer

- Responsible for managing UI screen logic and business logic, orchestrated by the ViewModel.
- The ViewModel acts as a gate to the next layer and incorporates state holders observed by the UI in a reactive programming style.

## Domain Layer

- Hosts entities like "Movie" for interactions with the UI.
- Contains a Repository deciding whether to fetch data from the Remote server or the Local database.
- Synchronization ensures seamless saving of newly fetched API data into the database, making the app offline-first.

## Data Layer

The Data Layer is divided into three components:

1. **API:**
   - Manages configurations, including creating API calls, interceptors, and preparing a Retrofit object for HTTP calls.

2. **Database:**
   - Configures the database and its DAO, implementing SQL queries through Room Database and its annotations.

3. **Models:**
   - Includes DTO objects that carry data, transferred from JSON through Moshi, between processes to implement Separation of Concerns (SOC).
